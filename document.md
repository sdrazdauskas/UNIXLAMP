## Biggest issues:
- Really long compile times
- Testing if changes worked is not really easy
- A bit hard read if everything compiled successfully as the output is massive for each part. Unless you watch the terminal 24/7
- Having to remake VMs to test final versions of code just incase you removed something that was actually necessary
- Fragile work, everything failing because one tiny change
